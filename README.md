There are two projects that are attatched into this Repo
First: 
The Express app project that is the server side of the main project to handle everything we need to implement in nodejs
----
The express project runs with "npm start" loading on 
http://localhost:3000

   Always in both cases, this projects runs on 
   http://localhost:4200

   Two ways to run this project:
   --Without using the proxy:
        "ng serve" :
            In case where we want to use its implementations without connecting it to the server
   --With using the proxy:
        "ng serve --proxy-config proxy.conf.json" :
            In the case where we have to connect it to the server
